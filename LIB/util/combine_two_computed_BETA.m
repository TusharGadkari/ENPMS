function [MAP_COMPUTED] = combine_two_computed_BETA(MyArray1,MyArray2,DATE_I,DATE_F)

%---------------------------------------------
% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
%
% This function combines all data in the containers into one container.
% Assumes daily data.
%
% BUGS:
% We aren't sure what happens when there is a duplicate key between containers(ie M11 and MSHE containers both have 'S331').
%  (we should probably put a checksum or something in for this)
%
% COMMENTS:
% keb: why are fprintf statements commented out? don't understand what this is supposed to do...
%
%----------------------------------------
% REVISION HISTORY:
%
% changes introduced to v1:  (keb 7/2011)
%  -changed input args from (M11, MSHE, DATE_I, DATE_F) to (MOLUZ, M11, MSHE, DFS2, DFS3, DATE_I, DATE_F)
%  -added functionality to work with dfs2 and dfs3 containers
%  -added try statements so script wouldn't crash if handed '0' instead of a container
%  -changed calculation of sz variable to look in all arrays for max number of model runs, therefore can handle empty containers

% changes introduced to v2: (keb 10/2011)
% -moved initialization of some variables to later in the script
% -removed lines: NAME(i) = KEY; % 2011-10-26 keb - removed because not used later in this routine
% -added some comments
% -changed name of TIMESERIES to TIMESERIES_DATA to avoid confusion with DATA_COMPUTED(i).TIMESERIES
%----------------------------------------

%get sz, which is number of alternatives we are combining (really this
%should be the same for all arrays or else i think this might function
%incorrectly) this also gets the correct size if we are requesting only one
